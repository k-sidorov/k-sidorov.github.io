    <p>An issue present in many state-of-the-art approaches to predict-and-optimize is the need to re-solve the same problem with different objective coefficients for each gradient computation. In this project, we investigate strategies for predict-and-optimize based on <em>decision diagrams</em> as a representation of a feasible set; since changing the objective values corresponds to re-weighting the diagram, our hypothesis is that we can derive a faster learning routine based on this idea.</p>

    <p>A common trait of loss functions in the predict-and-optimize field is that they give up some information about the problem to make the loss function continuous. To get a better idea of where the strengths and weaknesses lie of P+O losses, we want to find how much of this information on problem structure is retained. In this project, we would like to address the following question: How much of the problem structure do P+O loss functions capture?</p>

    <p>In this project, we have investigated the strategies for guiding a SAT solver into better solution for several variations of <i>resource-constrained
    project-scheduling problem</i> (RCPSP). A common theme between the subprojects was the importance of the seed values of the VSIDS branching heuristics;
    despite the common approval of VSIDS as a branching strategy, it has no built-in solution for the cold-start issue. The results of this project suggest
    several strategies for initializing VSIDS values in a way that triggers a solver into common heuristic solutions.</p>

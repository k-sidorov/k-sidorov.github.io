I attended the [CP 2024](https://cp2024.a4cp.org/) conference and presented the paper ["Pseudo-Boolean Reasoning About States and Transitions to Certify Dynamic Programming and Decision Diagram Algorithms"](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.CP.2024.9)
co-authored with [Emir Demirović](https://emirde.github.io/), [Ciaran McCreesh](https://ciaranm.github.io/),
[Matthew J. McIlree](https://matthewmcilree.com/), [Jakob Nordström](https://jakobnordstrom.se/), and [Andy Oertel](https://aoertel.de/). I have also presented our current progress on the resolution proof minimization project during the doctoral program.

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è Go back](/supervision/)

Here are answers to common questions I receive from students planning to work with me.

---

## üìÜ Meetings and communication

**How often do we meet?** Once a week by default; see my [supervision style](/supervision#my-supervision-style) for details. If something urgent comes up, email me.

**When can I expect a response from you?** If your inquiry is not covered by the default scenario of two days, I will let you know (either during a meeting or by correspondence) how much time I need to resolve your inquiry. 

**I received an email from you at 3 am. Do you want me to respond likewise?** While you will receive messages from me both off clock and on weekends, _I do not expect you to do the same_. I just find it easier sometimes to do some research-related activities overnight.

**What is your style of feedback?** See my [supervision style](/supervision#my-supervision-style) to get a broader idea. In short: verbal most of the time, written for major deliverables.

## üß™ Research process

**Do we write or code first?** We use an iterative cycle of writing, coding, and reflection. Writing early helps clarify the direction, and throwing together a prototype gives a ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the problem at hand.

**What if I get stuck?** *Talk to me.* Getting stuck is part of research. I would rather hear about a problem from you in the privacy of the meeting room than observe your thesis defense disintegrate in front of all your friends.

**But didn‚Äôt you say you want us to be independent?** Yes, but *independence is not isolation*. Try things on your own, but always keep me updated, even if it‚Äôs not going well.

## üìú Publications

**Do I need to publish?** No, but we *often try to*. If your project is strong enough, I will guide you through the process and help with submission and revisions.

**What if my project is _not_ strong enough?** Then we will not publish, and it is alright; your growth is more important.

## üë• Roles and responsibilities

**Who else is involved?** I am your day-to-day supervisor. An appointed faculty member will act as your *responsible professor* and sign off on your thesis proposal, intermediate documents, the final thesis text, as well as suggest the high-level research direction.

**What if I want to explore other topics?** That‚Äôs great! I‚Äôm happy to brainstorm alternatives, match you with faculty, or help shape your ideas into something researchable ‚Äì even if it‚Äôs not my area.

**What if we disagree?** We‚Äôll talk honestly and try to resolve any mismatch by finding a fair compromise. In rare cases where progress really stalls, I‚Äôll help you transition to another supervisor or project without friction.

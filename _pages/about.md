Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Konstantin, a PhD candidate at the [Algorithmics group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/algorithmics/people) at TU Delft.
I am working in *ConSol* research group led by [Emir DemiroviÄ‡](https://emirde.github.io/).
My research interests are in the intersection of decision-making algorithms, optimization, and explainability, with a special focus on optimality proofs.

I am also organizing [Monday's Outstanding Orations](https://m-o-o.org), a focused, technical, weekly seminar on combinatorial optimization. If you wish to discuss
your---or someone else's---research about constraint programming, SAT solving, mixed-integer programming, or any other similar topic,
don't hesitate to [reach out](https://forms.gle/kQy7pNfingDq5wQ48) to us!

In my downtime, I also answer questions on StackExchange, predominantly on their [Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/) and [Operation Research](https://or.stackexchange.com/) sites:

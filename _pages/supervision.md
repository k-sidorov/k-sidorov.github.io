I supervise MSc and BSc thesis projects at TU Delft in constraint programming, search methods, and combinatorial optimization, often aiming for publishable research. On this page, I explain how I work best and what you can expect from me as a supervisor; if you are a prospective student deciding whether you want to work with me, I hope you will find this page informative. Want to get a sense of my previous projects? Then [scroll down](#project-portfolio) for a list of projects I supervise or supervised.

Note: I am not a *responsible professor*. I mentor day-to-day, but official decisions, including your grade or your stay in the program, will require a senior faculty member. What follows is a **written description of how I work best as a supervisor**, rather than a formal set of rules. I have found that being transparent about my style helps students know what to expect and decide whether it suits their way of working.

‚ùì Want to address a more specific concern? Please check with [supervision FAQ](/supervision/faq).

## Goals

By the end of a project with me, I want you to have:

- An **authentic research experience**, rather than merely doing a coursework.
- **Ownership** of your topic and process.
- A **path to an academic publication**, if feasible given your project output.

## My supervision style

üìÖ **Weekly meetings** with structured agendas; I am hands-off in terms of format, but please let me know the night before what we will discuss this week.  
üó£Ô∏è **Verbal-first** feedback: I deliver most of my comments ‚Äúlive‚Äù during a meeting, and we work out together the best way to proceed. Of course, for _critical_ deliverables, such as your thesis draft, I will give written feedback.  
üóí **Constructive, specific, and high-level** feedback: you will receive many critical comments, but I will ground them in concrete, small-scale examples. I also focus my feedback on high-level concerns (e.g., whether your approach is feasible), rather than on minor, technical details.  
‚ôªÔ∏è **Iterative cycle**: write ‚Üí implement ‚Üí reflect ‚Üí improve.  
ü§ó **Hands-on support** without micromanagement: I will not write code or text for you, but you may rest assured that I will help out with either if you need it.

## What I expect from you

üí¨ **Consistent communication**, especially when stuck: remember that I can only help you if you indicate that you need help.  
ü§î **Curiosity, independence, and collaboration**: do not expect me to provide step-by-step instructions ‚Äì I value independence and critical thinking.   
ü™û **Willingness to reflect and adjust**: any progress requires changing your behavior; if you engage openly, I‚Äôll spend as much time as needed to help you improve.  
üßë‚Äçüî¨ **Active participation in writing and experimenting**: I will happily help you set up, execute, and describe a convincing experiment, but if you want to learn it, you will have to do it.

## My commitments to you

The points above describe my supervision style in broad strokes. If you are still feeling unsure about how this works day-to-day, check out the [supervision FAQ](/supervision/faq).

- I take your growth seriously and will support you technically and strategically.
- I will not disappear on you, block your ideas arbitrarily, or shift the goalposts.
- I‚Äôll be honest, constructive, and respectful ‚Äì and I expect the same.
- If we disagree, I will discuss it openly and work towards a fair solution.
